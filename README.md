# Drowsiness-Detection-System
My project focuses on developing a driver drowsiness detection system using computer vision and machine learning techniques. The system uses a camera to monitor the driver's facial expressions and eye movements in real-time.
By analyzing these features, the system can detect signs of drowsiness and alert the driver to prevent accidents. The goal is to enhance road safety by providing an early warning system for drivers who may be at risk of falling asleep at the wheel.
